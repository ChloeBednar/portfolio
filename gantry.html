      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p class="project-text">
        Overarching internship project to redesign an obscelete gantry workflow system for a midsize manufacturing company that had outgrown their prior manufacturing plant but maintained the same gantry setup. The main objective of the project was to design a new system that would eliminate mess, reduce wasted material, and improve overall efficiency of the operational workflow.

      <h2>Workflow Improvements</h2>
      <p class="project-text">
        The redesigned gantry workflow system incorporates several key improvements that collectively enhance the efficiency and usability of the system including:
        <ul class="project-bullets">
        <li>Improved trace of hose issues with color coded direction indicators on each hose</li>
        <li>Efficient out-of-the-way storage of extra material</li>
        <li>Organized bucket layout for improved foot-traffic flow</li>
        <li>More compact design that reduces the overall footprint of material storage</li>
        <li>Innovative design that features 3D printed components for concealing material within buckets</li>
        <li>Hose fitting connectivity that allows for efficient line transfers with minimal cleanup</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>Design Choices</h2>
      <p class="project-text">
        Key design choices involved developing a collar mechanism that could create a closed system between the pump and the material in the buckets. This prototyping phase involved meticulous attention to detail and putting intention behind each decision I made, such as creating hex shaped indents in the bottom of the 3D printed parts so the installation process would go quicker not needing to use a wrench on the backside. Additionally, I had to consider how the colllar, pump, and bucket would integrate together, so I designed the components to have a 20 degree tilt so the pump would sit in the bottom-most part of the bucket to allow it to collect maximum material. Another key design choice was integrating bulkheads into the trollies on the gantry to allow the thicker, 1/2" hoses, to encounter less wear-and-tear in comparison to the prior system due to their larger bending radius.
